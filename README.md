# INTRODUCTION

Planning is performed to determine a sequence of motion goals that satisfy individual task goals and trajectory planning is performed to determine actuator actions to realize the motion goals. Different algorithms are used to achieve path planning for robots at different levels. Over the semester with the course ENPM661, different task based and sampling based planning algorithms have been implemented in 2D using Python, OpenCV and in 3D using ROS, Gazebo, Python.
